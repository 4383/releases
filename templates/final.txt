versions, and links to individual project release notes documents

Congratulations to all of the teams who have contributed to this
release!

Our next production cycle, NEXT_SERIES, has already started. We will
meet in PTG_LOCATION PTG_DATES at the Project Team Gathering to plan
the work for the upcoming cycle. I hope to see you there!

Thanks,
