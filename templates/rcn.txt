Subject: [release][PROJECT] PROJECT SERIES release candidate available

Hello everyone,

A new release candidate for PROJECT for the end of the Newton cycle is
available.  You can find the source code tarball download link at

  https://releases.openstack.org/SERIES/index.html

Unless release-critical issues are found that warrant a release
candidate respin, this candidate will be formally released as the
final Newton release on DATE. You are therefore strongly encouraged to
test and validate this tarball!

Alternatively, you can directly test the stable/SERIES release branch
at

  http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/PROJECT/log/?h=stable/SERIES

If you find an issue that could be considered release-critical,
please file it at

  https://bugs.launchpad.net/PROJECT/+filebug

and tag it *SERIES-rc-potential* to bring it to the PROJECT release
crew's attention.

Thanks,
