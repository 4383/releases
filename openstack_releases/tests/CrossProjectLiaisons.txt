Many of our cross-project teams need focused help for communicating with the other project teams. This page lists the people who have volunteered for that work.

== Oslo ==

There are now more projects consuming code from the Oslo incubator than we have Oslo contributors. That means we are going to need your help to make these migrations happen. We are asking for one person from each project to serve as a liaison between the project and Oslo, and to assist with integrating changes as we move code out of the incubator into libraries.

* The liaison should be active in the project and familiar with the project-specific requirements for having patches accepted, but does not need to be a core reviewer or the PTL.
* The liaison should be prepared to assist with writing and reviewing patches in their project as libraries are adopted, and with discussions of API changes to the libraries to make them easier to use within the project.
* Liaisons should pay attention to [Oslo] tagged messages on the openstack-dev mailing list.
* It is also useful for liaisons to be able to attend the Oslo team meeting ([[Meetings/Oslo]]) to participate in discussions and raise issues for real-time discussion.

== Release management ==

The Release Management Liaison is responsible for communication with the Release Management team. Its tasks are described in the project team guide: https://docs.openstack.org/project-team-guide/release-management.html . That task has been traditionally filled by the PTL, but they may now delegate this task if they wish.

* By default, the liaison will be the PTL.
* The liaison may further delegate work to other subject matter experts

== QA ==

There are now more projects that are being tested by Tempest, and Grenade or a part deployable by Devstack than we have QA contributors. That means we are going to need your help to keep on top of everything. We are asking for one person from each project to serve as a liaison between the project and QA, and to assist with integrating changes as we move forward.

The liaison should be a core reviewer for the project, but does not need to be the PTL. The liaison should be prepared to assist with writing and reviewing patches that interact with their project, and with discussions of changes to the QA projects to make them easier to use within the project.

== Documentation ==

The OpenStack Documentation is centralized on docs.openstack.org but often there's a need for specialty information when reviewing patches or triaging doc bugs. A doc liaison should be available to triage doc bugs when the docs team members don't know enough to triage accurately, and be added to doc reviews that affect your project. You'd be notified through email when you're added either to a doc bug or a doc review. We also would appreciate attendance at the [https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Meetings/DocTeamMeeting weekly doc team meeting], We meet weekly in #openstack-meeting every Wednesday at alternating times for different timezones:

== Stable Branch ==

The Stable Branch Liaison is responsible for making sure backports are proposed for critical issues in their project, and make sure proposed backports
are reviewed. They are also the contact point for stable branch release managers around point release times.

* By default, the liaison will be the PTL.
* The Stable Branch Liaison is considered a contributor to the Release Cycle Management Program and therefore is allowed to vote in its PTL election.
* The liaison may further delegate work to other subject matter experts

== Vulnerability management ==

The Vulnerability Management Team needs domain specialists to help assessing the impact of reported issues, coordinate the development of patches, review proposed patches and propose backports. The liaison should be familiar with the [https://security.openstack.org/vmt-process.html Vulnerability Management process] and embargo rules, and have a good grasp of security issues in software design.

* The liaison should be a core reviewer for the project, but does not need to be the PTL.
* By default, the liaison will be the PTL.
* The liaison is the first line of contact for the Vulnerability Management team members
* The liaison is considered a contributor to the Release Cycle Management Program and therefore is allowed to vote in election its PTL
* The liaison may further delegate work to other subject matter experts
* The liaison maintains the members of the $PROJECT-coresec team in Launchpad (which can be given access to embargoed vulnerabilities)

== API Working Group ==

The [[API_Working_Group|API Working Group]] seeks API subject matter experts for each project  to communicate plans for API updates, review API guidelines with their project's view in mind, and review the API Working Group guidelines as they are drafted. The liaison should be familiar with the project's REST API design and future planning for changes to it.

The members of the [http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/api-wg/liaisons.html API Working Group Cross-Project Liaisons] are maintained in our repo.  If you want to read the entire list of CPLs or add/remove yourself from the list, you'll need to update the [http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/api-wg/tree/doc/source/liaisons.json liaisons.json] file. If you don't want to make the update yourself, please ask in #openstack-sdks on IRC and someone can make the change for you.

== Logging Working Group ==

The [[LogWorkingGroup|Log Working Group]] seeks experts for each project  to assist with making the logging in projects match the new [http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/openstack-specs/specs/log-guidelines.html Logging Guidelines]

== Infra ==

These are the project specific groups of people that Infra will look to ACK changes to that project's test configuration. Changes to project-config and devstack-gate should be +1'd by these groups when they are related to their project. Note that in an emergency this may not always be possible and Infra will ask for forgiveness but generally we should look for these +1s.

== Product Working Group ==
The product working group consists of product managers, technologists, and operators from a diverse set of organizations.  The group is working to aggregate user stories from the market-focused teams (Enterprise, Telco, etc.) and cross-project functional teams (e.g. logging, upgrades, etc.), partner with the development community on resourcing, and help gather data to generate a multi-release roadmap.  Most of the user stories being tracked by this team consists of items that can span multiple releases and usually have cross-project dependencies.  

More information about the team can be found on the [[ProductTeam|Product WG wiki]].

== I18n ==
I18n team is responsible for making OpenStack ubiquitously accessible to people of all language backgrounds. The team have translators from all over the world to translate OpenStack into different languages. 

If you want to communicate with translators in I18n team, send email to openstack-i18n@lists.openstack.org.

* The liaison should be a core reviewer for the project and understand i18n status of the project.
* The liaison should understand project release schedule very well.
* The liaison should notify I18n team happens of important moments in the project release in time. For example, happen of soft string freeze, happen of hard string freeze, and happen of RC1 cutting.
* The liaison should take care of translation patches to the project, and make sure the patches are successfully merged to the final release version. When the translation patch is failed, the liaison should notify I18n team.

== Inter-project Liaisons ==

In some cases, it is useful to have liaisons between projects. [http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2015-April/062327.html For example, it is useful for the Nova and Neutron projects to have liaisons, because the projects have complex interactions and dependencies.] Ideally, a cross-project effort should have two members, one from each project, to facilitate communication and knowledge transfer.

=== Etherpads ===

The following is a list of etherpads that are used for inter-project liaisons, and are continuously updated.

Nova - Neutron: https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/nova-neutron

== Cross-Project Spec Liaisons ==

The OpenStack project relies on the cross-project spec liaisons from each participating project to help with coordination and cross-project spec related tasks. See full set of [https://docs.openstack.org/project-team-guide/cross-project.html#cross-project-specification-liaisons responsibilities] The liaison defaults to the PTL, but the PTL can also delegate the responsibilities to someone else on the team by updating this tableː
