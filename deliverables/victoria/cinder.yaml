cycle-highlights:
  - Improved handling around the configured default volume-type and
    added new Block Storage API calls with microversion 3.62 that enable
    setting a project-level default volume-type for individual projects.
  - Added some new backend drivers, and many current drivers have added
    support for more features.  For example, the NFS driver now supports
    volume encryption.
  - Support was added to cinder backup to use the popular Zstandard
    compression algorithm.
