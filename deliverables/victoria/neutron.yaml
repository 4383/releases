cycle-highlights:
  - Metadata service is now available over IPv6. Users can now use metadata
    service without config drive in IPv6-only networks.
  - Support for ``flat`` networks has been added for Distributed Virtual
    Routers (``DVR``).
  - Support for Floating IP port forwarding has been added for the ``OVN``
    backend. Users can now create port forwardings for Floating IPs
    when the OVN backend is used in Neutron.
  - Added support for router availability zones in OVN. The OVN driver
    can now read from the routerâ€™s availability_zone_hints field and
    schedule router ports accordingly with the given availability zones.
