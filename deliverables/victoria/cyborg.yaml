    Users can launch instances with accelerators managed by Cyborg since Ussuri
    release, this release two more operations * Rebuild and * Evacuate are
    supported. See `accelerator operation guide
    <https://docs.openstack.org/api-guide/compute/accelerator-support.html>`_
    to find all supported operations.
  - |
    Cyborg supported new accelerator drivers (Intel QAT and Inspur FPGA) and
    reached an agreement that Vendors who want to implement a new driver should
    at least provide a full driver report result. (Of course, providing
    third-party CI is more welcome.) `Supported drivers
    <https://docs.openstack.org/cyborg/latest/reference/support-matrix.html>_`

    Program API is supported, now users can program FPGA given the pre-uploaded
    bitstream. `program API (PATCH deployable)
    <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/cyborg-specs/specs/train/approved/cyborg-api.html>_`
    And API microversion for existed APIs is improved such as arq APIs.
  - |
    In this release, the policy refresh (RBAC with scoped) for cyborg is
    partially implemented (Device Profile APIs), we've implemented new default
    rules in base policy and device_profile policy, and added the basic
    testing framework for all policies.
    For the Backward Compatibility, old rules are maintained as deprecated
    rules with same defaults as today so that existing deployment will keep
    working as it is. After we implement all the features, we'll give two
    cycles transition period for operators. See `policy default refresh
    <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/cyborg-specs/specs/ussuri/approved/policy-defaults-refresh.html>`_
