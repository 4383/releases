cycle-highlights:
  - Improved time-to-first-byte latencies when reading erasure-coded data.
  - Increased isolation between background daemons and proxy-servers when running with a separate replication network.
  - We're beginning to see non-trivial production clusters transition from running Swift under Python 2 to Python 3.
