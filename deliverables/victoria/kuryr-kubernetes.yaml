cycle-highlights:
  - |
    Kuryr will no longer use annotations to store data about OpenStack objects
    in K8s API. Instead a corresponding CRDs are created, i.e. KuryrPort,
    KuryrLoadBalancer and KuryrNetworkPolicy.
  - |
    Logs on INFO level should be much cleaner now.
  - |
    Added support for autodetection of VM bridging interface in nested setups.
