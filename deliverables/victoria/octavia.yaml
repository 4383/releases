team: octavia
type: service
cycle-highlights:
  - Users can now specify the TLS versions accepted for listeners and pools.
    Operators also now have the ability to set a minimum TLS version
    acceptable for their deployment.
  - Octavia now supports HTTP/2 over TLS using the new Application Layer
    Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) configuration option for listeners.
  - Load balancer statistics can now be reported to multiple statistics
    drivers simultaneously and supports delta metrics. This allows easier
    integration into external metrics system, such as a time series database.
  - Octavia flavors for the amphora driver now support specifying the glance
    image tag as part of the flavor. This allows the operator to define
    Octavia flavors that boot alternate amphora images.
  - Load balancer pools now support version two of the PROXY protocol. This
    allows passing client information to member servers when using TCP
    protocols. PROXYV2 improves the performance of establishing new connections
    using the PROXY protocol to member servers, especially when the listener
    is using IPv6.
