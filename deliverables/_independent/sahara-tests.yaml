  - version: 0.3.0
    highlights: >
        All high-level tests based on tempest.lib (proper API Tempest
        tests including the data_processing client, CLI and python client
        tests) have been consolidated here.
        Also, the number of those tests increased significantly.
        Scenario tests have been enhanced with the support for the newer
        plugins, more documentation and cleanup of EDP jobs (especially
        Java-based), and os-client-config is used to read the credentials.
        This release supports the Liberty, Mitaka and Newton releases of
        OpenStack.

  - version: 0.4.0
    highlights: >
        The amount of API and CLI tests was increased and made
        more robusts (after-tests cleanups).
        The scenario test framework now requires less parameters and on
        the other side there are more parameters that can be overridden.
        The time of each test phase is now clearly shown.
        This release supports the Mitaka, Newton and Ocata releases of
        OpenStack.
