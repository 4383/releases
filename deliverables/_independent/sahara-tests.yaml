        All high-level tests based on tempest.lib (proper API Tempest
        tests including the data_processing client, CLI and python client
        tests) have been consolidated here.
        Also, the number of those tests increased significantly.
        Scenario tests have been enhanced with the support for the newer
        plugins, more documentation and cleanup of EDP jobs (especially
        Java-based), and os-client-config is used to read the credentials.
        This release supports the Liberty, Mitaka and Newton releases of
        OpenStack.
