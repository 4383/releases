cycle-highlights:
  - Support for disabling and enabling failover segments.
    This way operators are able to put whole segments into maintenance
    mode instead of having to do it for each single host.
  - Support for smoothing-out the decision about whether to consider a host
    down or not. Operators can configure host monitors to consider a chosen
    number of probes before sending the notification about host being down.
  - Support for running host monitors in environments without systemd,
    such as app containers.
  - Support for using system-scoped tokens when contacting Nova.
