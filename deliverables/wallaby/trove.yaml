cycle-highlights:
  - Support image tags for the datastore version. When using image tags, Trove
    is able to get the image dynamically from Glance for creating instances.
  - Added custom container registry configuration for trove guest agent, it's
    now possible to use images in private registry rather than docker hub.
  - Added a new field ``operating_status`` for the instance to show the actual
    operational status of user's database.
  - In multi-region deployment with geo-replicated Swift, the user can restore
    a backup in one region by manually specifying the original backup data
    location created in another region.
