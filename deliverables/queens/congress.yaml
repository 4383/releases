cycle-highlights:
  - 'Mistral Integration: Congress can now trigger workflows according to
    operator-defined policy. From sending emails to running ansible playbooks,
    Congress and Mistral can take infrastructure automation and fault-recovery
    to the next level.'
  - 'Config Validation: To help operators catch improper, insecure, or incompatible
    configurations across the Stack, the new configuration validation facility
    enables Congress to monitor service configurations according to policy.'
  - 'Tag-based Security: To help operators secure and manage self-service
    infrastructure, Congress now supports enforcement of application-based network
    security policies based on tags and other semantic information.'
  - 'Bug Fixes: As with every release, we continue to make Congress more robust and
    stable than ever.'
