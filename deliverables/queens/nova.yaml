cycle-highlights:
  - |
    The performance of listing instances across a multi-cell cells v2
    deployment has been improved and the results are now merge sorted.
  - |
    Rescheduling during a server create or resize operation is now supported
    in a split-MQ multi-cell cells v2 deployment.
  - |
    The libvirt compute driver supports volume multi-attach when using the
    2.60 compute API microversion. See the `admin guide
    <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/manage-volumes.html#volume-multi-attach>`__
    for more details on volume multi-attach support in Queens.
  - |
    Added support for vGPUs. Experimental feature with some caveats, but admins
    can now define flavors that request vGPU resources. See `admin guide
    <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/virtual-gpu.html>`__ for more
    details.
  - |
    Traits-based scheduling is now available for the ironic compute driver.
    For more details, see the `ironic docs for scheduling based on traits
    <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/install/configure-nova-flavors.html#scheduling-based-on-traits>`_.
