cycle-highlights:
  - |
    Nova is now using the new Neutron port binding API to minimize network
    downtime during live migrations. See the `related spec
    <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/specs/rocky/approved/neutron-new-port-binding-api.html>`_
    for more details.

    Volume-backed instances will no longer report ``root_gb`` usage for new
    instances and existing instances will heal during move operations.

    A ``nova-manage db purge`` command to `purge archived shadow table data
    <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/cli/nova-manage.html#nova-database>`_
    is now available. A new ``--purge`` option is also available for the
    ``nova-manage db archive_deleted_rows`` command.

    It is now possible to `disable a cell
    <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/cli/nova-manage.html#nova-cells-v2>`_
    to stop scheduling to a cell by using the
    ``nova-manage cell_v2 update_cell`` command.
