cycle-highlights:
  - 'Per TCP/UDP port forwarding on floating IP is supported. Operators can save the
    number of global IP addresses for floating IPs.'
  - 'Multiple bindings for compute owned ports is supported for better instance migration
    support. Better live-migration support is a long-standing topic and Nova support
    will be coming in the next Stein release.'
  - 'Perform validation on filter parameters on listing resources. Previously filter
    parameters were unclear for API users. This release improves the API behavior
    on resource filtering and documentation in the Neutron API references a lot.'
  - '(fwaas) Logging on firewall events is supported. It is useful for operators to
    debug FWaaS.'
  - '(vpnaas) Newer versions of liberswan 3.19+ are supported so that operators can
    run neutron-vpnaas IPsec VPN with newer distributions.'
  - '(ovn) Support migration from an existing ML2OVS TripleO deployment to ML2OVN
    TripleO deployment.'
  - '(bagpipe) bagpipe-bgp, a reference implementation of Neutron BGP VPN support,
    supports E-VPN with OVS.'
