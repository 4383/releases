cycle-highlights:
  - 'Adds additional interfaces for management of hardware including Redfish
    BIOS settings, explicit iPXE boot interface option, and additional
    hardware support.'
  - 'Increased capabilities and options for operators including deployment
    templates, improved parallel conductor workers and disk erasure processes,
    deployed node protection and descriptions, and use of local HTTP(S) servers
    for serving images.'
  - 'Improved options for standalone users to request allocations of bare metal
    nodes and submit configuration data as opposed to pre-formed configuration
    drives. Additionally allows for ironic to be leveraged using JSON-RPC as
    opposed to an AMQP message bus.'
