cycle-highlights:
  - Adds additional interfaces for management of hardware including
    Redfish BIOS settings, explicit iPXE boot interface option, and
    additional hardware support.
  - Increased capabilities and options for operators including deployment
    templates, improved parallel conductor workers and disk erasure
    processes, deployed node protection and descriptions, and use of
    local HTTP(S) servers for serving images.
  - Improved options for standalone users to request allocations of
    bare metal nodes and submit configuration data as opposed to pre-formed
    configuration drives. Additionally allows for ironic to be leveraged
    using JSON-RPC as opposed to an AMQP message bus.
