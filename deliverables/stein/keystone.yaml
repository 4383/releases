cycle-highlights:
  - This release introduced Multi-Factor Authentication Receipts, which
    facilitates a much more natural sequential authentication flow when using
    MFA.
  - The limits API now supports domains in addition to projects, so quota for
    resources can be allocated to top-level domains and distributed among
    children projects.
  - JSON Web Tokens are added as a new token format alongside fernet tokens,
    enabling support for a internet-standard format. JSON Web Tokens are
    asymmetrically signed and so synchronizing private keys across keystone
    servers is no longer required with this token format.
  - Multiple keystone APIs now support system scope as a policy target, which
    reduces the need for customized policies to prevent global access to users
    with an admin role on any project.
  - Multiple keystone APIs now use default reader, member, and admin roles
    instead of a catch-all role, which reduces the need for customized policies
    to create read-only access for certain users.
