cycle-highlights:
  - 'Support for strict minimum bandwidth based scheduling. With this feature, Nova
    instances can be scheduled to compute hosts that will honor the minimum bandwidth
    requirements of the instance as defined by QoS policies of its ports.'
  - 'Network Segment Range Management. This features enables cloud administrators
    to manage network segment ranges dynamically via a new API extension, as opposed
    to the previous approach of editing configuration files. This feature targets
    StarlingX and edge use cases, where ease of of management is paramount.'
  - 'Speed up Neutron port bulk creation. The targets are containers / k8s use cases,
    where ports are created in groups.'
  - '(FWaaS) FWaaS v1 has been removed. FWaaS v2 is available since Newton release
    and it covers all features in FWaaS v1. A migartion script is provided to convert
    existing FWaaS v1 objects into FWaaS v2 models.'
