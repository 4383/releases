cycle-highlights:
  - 'It is now possible to run Nova with version 1.0.0 of the recently extracted placement
    service, hosted from its own repository. Note that install/upgrade of an extracted
    placement service is not yet fully implemented in all deployment tools. Operators
    should check with their particular deployment tool for support before proceeding.
    See the placement `install <https://docs.openstack.org/placement/latest/install/index.html>`_
    and `upgrade <https://docs.openstack.org/placement/latest/upgrade/to-stein.html>`_
    documentation for more details. In Stein, operators may choose to continue to
    run with the integrated placement service from the Nova repository, but should
    begin planning a migration to the extracted placement service by Train, as the
    removal of the integrated placement code from Nova is planned for the Train release.'
  - 'Users can now specify a volume type when creating servers.'
  - 'The compute API is now tolerant of transient conditions in a deployment like
    partial infrastructure failures, for example a cell not being reachable.'
  - 'Users can now create servers with Neutron ports that have quality-of-service
    minimum bandwidth rules.'
  - 'Operators can now set overcommit allocation ratios using Nova configuration files
    or the placement API.'
  - 'Compute driver capabilities are now automatically exposed as traits in the placement
    API so they can be used for scheduling via flavor extra specs and/or image properties.'
  - 'Live migration is now supported for the VMware driver.'
