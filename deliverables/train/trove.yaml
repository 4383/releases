cycle-highlights:
  - A lot of improvements have been made for the Service Tenant
    Deployment model which is highly recommended in the production
    environment. The cloud administrator is allowed to define the
    management resources for the trove instance, such as keypair,
    security group, network, etc.
  - Creating trove guest image becomes much easier for the cloud
    administrator or developer by using ``trovestack`` script.
  - Users could expose the trove instance to the public with the ability
    to limit source IP addresses access to the database.
