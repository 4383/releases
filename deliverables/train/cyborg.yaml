    Got Cyborg-Nova interaction spec merged. This is the blueprint for
    the end goal, i.e., launching and managing VMs with accelerators.
    <https://github.com/openstack/nova-specs/blob/master/specs/train/approved/nova-cyborg-interaction.rst>
  - |
    Updated Cyborg APIs to version 2, which includes support for Nova
    interaction.  Using v2 APIs, end users can create/delete device profiles
    and create/bind/unbind/delete accelerator requests (ARQs).
  - |
    Added new Cyborg driver (Ascend) and improved existing drivers
    (Intel FPGA, GPU).
  - |
    Created tempest CI framework that can be used with a fake driver today and
    with real hardware in the future.
  - |
    Enabled Python 3 testing and fixed issues in support of Train goals.
