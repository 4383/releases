  - 'A v2 API, along with five new endpoints has been introduced.
     It is marked as ``EXPERIMENTAL`` for now. Its endpoints support timezones,
     and aim at being more generic and efficient than v1 endpoints.'
  - 'A Prometheus scope fetcher has been added. It allows dynamic scope
     discovery from Prometheus and is intended to be used with the Prometheus
     collector.'
  - 'Fault-tolerance and performance of the processor has been improved.
     Each processor does now spawn several workers, which are restarted in
     case of a failure.'
  - 'A v2 storage driver for Elasticsearch has been introduced. It is marked as
     ``EXPERIMENTAL`` for now.'
