    Shares can be created from snapshots across storage pools when
    compatible. This new feature allows better utilization of back end
    resources by spreading workloads that were previously confined to the
    back end that hosted the snapshot.
  - |
    New quota control mechanisms have been introduced to constrain projects
    and their users to the number and size of share replicas they can create.
  - |
    It is now possible to query asynchronous user messages with time
    intervals.
