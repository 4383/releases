    highlights: |
      Added support for the new worker model, which will replace both
      pool-manager and zone-manager services. This disabled by default,
      but can be enabled by setting ``['service:worker'].enabled`` to ``True``
      and starting ``designate-producer`` and ``designate-worker`` services.
