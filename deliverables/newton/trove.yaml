        features:
          - Add support for configuration group management for DB2
            Express-C.
          - Add support for full online backup and restore for DB2
            Express-C by enabling archive logging.
          - The reset-status command will set the task and status of
            an instance to ERROR after which it can be deleted.
          - The force-delete command will allow the deletion of an
            instance even if the instance is stuck in BUILD state.
          - The --incremental flag for backup-create will add the
            ability to create incremental backup based on last full or
            incremental backup. If no full or incremental backup
            exists a new full backup will be created.
          - New instance upgrade API supports upgrading an instance of
            a datastore to a new datastore version.  Includes
            implementation for MySQL family of databases.
          - A locality flag was added to the trove ReST API to allow a
            user to specify whether the instances of a cluster should
            be on the same hypervisor (affinity) or on different
            hypervisors (anti-affinity).
          - Support for standard WAL based streaming replication for
            postgresql guests. Sets up read-only hot standby servers.
          - New quota management APIs for reviewing and changing the
            quota for a particular tenant.  Requires admin privileges.
          - Add disk column in flavor-list (Bug 1617987).
          - Add vCPU column in flavor-list (Bug 1261876).
          - Add support for scheduled backups through Mistral.
          - Add log retreival capability for Cassandra datastores.
          - Add New Relic license driver.
          - Add PostgreSQL Incremental Backup and Restore.

            all_datastore_versions now works correctly. (Bug 1612430)
