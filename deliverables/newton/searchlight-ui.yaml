      release. These changes are not backwards compatible with previous
      Horizon releases. Several small code organization improvements were
      also done.

      Searchlight UI now makes use of newly landed Horizon
      registered drawer and detail views for resources. It also
      adds support for global actions (like creating an image) and
      has started enhancing action result handling.
