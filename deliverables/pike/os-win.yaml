    highlights: |
      This release removes a configuration option (force_volume_utils_v1),
      and the ISCSIInitiatorCLIUtils, which were deprecated since Mitaka.
      os_win.utilsfactory.get_iscsi_initiator_utils will return
      ISCSITargetUtils instead.
      IOThread has been removed, as it was not used since Mitaka.
      LiveMigrationUtils will no longer create a planned VM when
      live_migrate_vm is called. Callers are expected to create one, if
      necessary (e.g.: if ISCSI volume attached). This behaviour has been
      enforced in nova since Newton.
      NetworkUtils now has the set_vswitch_port_profile_id method, which is
      required for new Windows Server 2016 Network Controller.
      Adds utils required for nova-assisted volume snapshots.
