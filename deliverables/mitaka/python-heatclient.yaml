      This is the first stable release of python-heatclient. This release also
      contains a full set of heat commands for the python-openstackclient
      client. These new commands would not have been achieved without the help
      of many new and existing contributors, so we would like to thank:

      - Amey Bhide
      - Bryan Jones
      - Di XiaoLi
      - Jason Dunsmore
      - Kanagaraj Manickam
