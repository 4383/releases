`release:cycle-with-milestones`_ model.

.. _o-final-lib:

Final release for non-client libraries
--------------------------------------

Libraries that are not client libraries (Oslo and others) should issue their
final release during this week. That allows to give time for last-minute
changes before feature freeze.

.. _o-3:

ocata-3 milestone
------------------

XXX is the ocata-3 milestone window for projects following the
`release:cycle-with-milestones`_ model.

.. _o-ff:

Feature freeze
--------------

The ocata-3 milestone marks feature freeze for projects following the
`release:cycle-with-milestones`_ model. No featureful patch should be landed
after this point. Exceptions may be granted by the project PTL.

.. _o-final-clientlib:

Final release for client libraries
----------------------------------

Client libraries should issue their final release during this week, to match
feature freeze.

.. _o-soft-sf:

Soft StringFreeze
-----------------

You are no longer allowed to accept proposed changes containing modifications
in user-facing strings. Such changes should be rejected by the review team
and postponed until the next series development opens (which should happen
when RC1 is published).

.. _o-rc1:

RC1 target week
---------------

The week of XXX is the target date for projects following the
`release:cycle-with-milestones`_ model to issue their first release candidate.

.. _o-hard-sf:

Hard StringFreeze
-----------------

This happens when the RC1 for the project is tagged. At this point, ideally
no strings are changed (or added, or removed), to give translator time to
finish up their efforts.

.. _o-finalrc:

Final RCs and intermediary releases
-----------------------------------

The week of XXX is the last week to issue release candidates
or intermediary releases before release week. On release week only
final-release-critical releases will be accepted (at the discretion of the
release team).

.. _o-release:

Ocata release
--------------

The Ocata coordinated release will happen on XXX.
