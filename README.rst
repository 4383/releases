============================
 OpenStack Release Tracking
============================

This repository is for tracking release requests for OpenStack
projects. The releases are managed using groups of "deliverables",
made up of individual project repositories sharing a Launchpad group
and a version number history. Many deliverables will only have one
constituent project.

Refer to `doc/source/instructions.rst` for details about how to submit
requests.
