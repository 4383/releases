=======================
 Using This Repository
=======================

All official OpenStack software should go through the
`Release Management team
<https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/projects/release-management.html>`_
team to produce releases. Exceptions to this rule are granted by
the Technical Committee and documented in the openstack/governance
repository ('release-management' key in reference/projects.yaml).

This repository is used to track release requests. Releases are managed
using groups of "deliverables", made up of individual project repositories
sharing a Launchpad group and a version number history. Many deliverables
will only have one constituent project repository.

The repository is managed by the `Release Management team
<https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/projects/release-management.html>`_.

Refer to `the reference documentation

Deliverables managed by teams not under OpenStack governance should
follow the `tagging instructions in the infra manual
<https://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/drivers.html#tagging-a-release>`__.
