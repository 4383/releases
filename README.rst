=======================
 Using This Repository
=======================

This repository is for tracking release requests for OpenStack
projects. The releases are managed using groups of "deliverables",
made up of individual project repositories sharing a Launchpad group
and a version number history. Many deliverables will only have one
constituent project.

The repository is managed by the `Release Management team
<https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/projects/release-management.html>`_.
